Requests4Droid
==============

*Inspired by the struggle to send HTTP Requests from an android app at hack RU. 
*This library simplifies the process of connecting to a URL and perfroming HTTP requests from an Android. 
  *The library abstracts the user away from the mess of creating an HTTP connection and formatting params by hand
*It will support GET and POST requests
*These requests will run on their own thread

Sample Implementation coming soon!
